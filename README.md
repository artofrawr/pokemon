# Pokemon

My kids like Pokémon. So I like Pokémon.

This repo contains some Pokémon Trading Card Game Online (PTCGO) related python scripts.

## Game Related

### Auto Redeemer

`python pokemon.py redeem`  
This script assumes that the game is running in my primary monitor at a specific resolution. It will then look at the file `codes.txt` and redeem every booster pack code it finds in there.

## Utility / Debugging

### Mouse Position

`python pokemon.py mouse`  
This script will continually echo the mouse position.
